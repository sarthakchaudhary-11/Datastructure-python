        "# Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their specific problem.\n",
        "# Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and functions for a wide range of tasks, from file handling to web development. This means developers can accomplish many tasks without needing third-party libraries.\n",
        "# Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for developers working in different environments.\n",
        "# Python's simplicity and dynamic typing allow for quick prototyping, making it an excellent choice for startups and projects where time-to-market is critical.\n",
        "# Python is increasingly used in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis, and automation, making it a relevant skill in today’s job market.\n",
